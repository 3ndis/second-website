	<div class="content">
<p> China is holding another round of military drills in the South China Sea amid an uptick in such activity in the area highlighting growing tensions.</p>

<p>The Maritime Safety Administration said the exercises would run from Monday through Sunday. It warned outside vessels to steer 5 nautical miles (9.26 kilometers) clear of the drill area but otherwise gave no details.</p>

<p>China announced late last month that it had held drills in the South China Sea involving long-range bombers and other aircraft.</p>

<p>Chinese forces have also confronted U.S. Naval vessels conducting “freedom of navigation operations” near Chinese-held islands, as well as forces from Australia and countries that challenge China’s claim to the entire strategic waterway.</p>
